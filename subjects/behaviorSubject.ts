// Behavior Subject works as follows

/**
 * Imagine a sports game being broadcasted
 * Each new score is displayed on the screen (the behavior subject)
 * As each new subscription is added, the behavior subject Sends
 * a next notification with the latest state of the score.
 *
 * The subscriber then can react to the latest emission
